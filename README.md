# ORB_SLAM2-IOS
This is iOS port of [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) with modified dependency for iOS.

And this link is iOS port of [ORB-SLAM1](https://github.com/ygx2011/ORB_SLAM-IOS).

You need to download some dependency and opencv2.framework from
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1i5fsyot

Unzip orbslam2ios.zip and put the dependency folder and opencv2.framework in the orbslamios folder.

You can do some AR projects. If you are interested in SLAM-AR, you can see my another project [Stereo-SLAM-AR](https://github.com/ygx2011/Stereo_SLAM_AR).
